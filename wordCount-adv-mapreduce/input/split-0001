'''''Rocky IV''''' is the fourth and most successful movie, in terms of box office gross, of the ''  Rocky  '' franchise.  http   www.boxofficemojo.com franchises chart ?id rocky.htm      Rocky Balboa  character |Rocky Balboa    played again by   Sylvester Stallone   , has said he plans to retire from boxing after recovering his title from   Clubber Lang   in ''  Rocky III  ''.  A new sensation from the   Soviet Union  ,   Ivan Drago  Character |Ivan Drago    played by   Dolph Lundgren   , however, begins to emerge as a top contender.

  Plot  
The year is   1985   and following another friendly sparring match with   Apollo Creed  , Rocky returns to his home in   Philadelphia   to celebrate Paulie's birthday. Its also Rocky and Adrian's  almost  9 year anniversary.   Ivan Drago     Dolph Lundgren   , a highly intimidating 261 pound   Soviet   boxer, arrives in America to challenge the best   United States|American   fighters.   Apollo Creed  , motivated by patriotism and a desire to prove himself after retirement, quickly jumps at the chance to step back into the ring in an exhibition bout against Drago. Despite apprehension from Rocky, who eventually agrees to help train him, Apollo sets the match between himself and Drago in   Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas  . With Rocky in his corner, Apollo flamboyantly makes his way to the ring with a bigger show than when he first fought Rocky, which includes fireworks,   James Brown   performing  quot;  Living in America  song |Living in America  , quot; and a patriotic theme, including a crowd implacably hostile to the visiting Soviet boxer. The match, which apparently was supposed to be for fun, ends in tragedy in the second round as Apollo, who took an unmerciful beating from Drago and refused to allow Rocky to throw in the towel, is killed in the ring by one final hard shot from Drago.
  Image Drago.PNG|thumb|left|200px|Rocky Balboa faces up to Ivan Drago in ''Rocky IV''  
After Apollo's funeral, feeling grief over not stopping the fight, and incensed by Drago's cold indifference to killing Apollo,   quot;If he dies, he dies. quot;  Rocky decides he must avenge Apollo's death and sets a match with the Russian. The match is set for   Christmas Day  , in   Moscow  , but Rocky's title is not on the line because the boxing commission refuses to sanction the fight. Adrian initially cannot understand why Rocky would fight, fearing for his life. Rocky flies to a remote and rustic part of the Soviet Union to train; to help with his training he brings Apollo's former trainer Tony  quot;Duke quot; Evers and his brother-in-law Paulie. Training runs for several months, with Rocky using more humble methods like chopping wood, running up snowy embankments, and lifting huge rocks; Drago is using the most modern equipment coupled with regular injections of what is implied to be   anabolic steroid  s. During one of his runs, Rocky returns to find Adrian waiting for him. With Adrian providing more reason to succeed, Rocky begins to train even harder. 
  Image Dragopunched.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Rocky Balboa delivers the  quot;turning point quot; of the match.   

After intense preparation for both fighters, the two men finally meet in the ring. The match set in Moscow, before the   Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Politburo  , and is broadcast throughout the globe. The crowd is strongly against Rocky, booing him fiercely and cheering Drago, as the American crowd cheered Creed and booed Drago in Las Vegas. After the ring introductions, an impassive Drago tells Rocky,  quot;I must break you. quot; After a pummeling first round, with the Russian easily winning, Rocky comes back toward the end of the second and cuts Drago just below his eye. With Drago's confidence shaken by the injury and Rocky's apparently limitless endurance and resilience, this is a turning point as Rocky and his trainers see that Drago is not superhuman as he appears, conversely while Drago describes Rocky as non-human and a  quot;piece of iron. quot; 

The fight degenerates into a brutal battle of stamina and will across all fifteen rounds. By the end, the Soviet crowd has been won over by Rocky's determination and endurance, and have begun chanting his name. One Politburo member is angered by the crowd's change in mood and gets up to the ring to berate Drago's performance; Drago then throttles the official and tosses him aside, saying  quot;I fight for me...FOR ME....  quot; In the fifteenth and final round, both fighters batter at each other, but Drago's endurance finally runs out, while Rocky finds his last burst of strength and lands one final signature left hook that finally knocks out the Russian.

Following his victory, Rocky gives an impassioned speech to the crowd, acknowledging their initial and mutual disdain for each other, and how they've come to respect and admire each other during the fight. Saying that the brutal battle between him and Drago in the ring was better than war between their two countries, he brings the crowd, including the Politburo, to its feet in applause, by claiming that  quot;if I can change and you can change, then everybody can change  quot;

  Production  
  Expand|date January 2007  
Wyoming doubled for the frozen expanse of the Soviet Union.  The small farm where Rocky lived and trained was located in   Jackson Hole  , and the   Grand Teton National Park   was used for filming many of the outdoor sequences in Russia.  The   PNE Forum   at   Hastings Park   in   Vancouver  ,   British Columbia  , served as the location of Rocky's Soviet bout.  Ironically, the site would later house production of another U.S.-Soviet sports film, ''  Miracle  film  | Miracle  ''. 

Sylvester Stallone has stated that the punching between him and Dolph Lundgren in the first portion of the fight is completely authentic. One particularly forceful punch to Stallone's chest slammed his heart against his breastbone, causing the heart to swell and his breathing to become labored.  Stallone, suffering from labored breathing and a blood pressure over 200, was flown from the set in Canada to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica and was kept in intensive care for eight days. lt;ref gt;  cite web | url http   www.aintitcool.com node 30932 | title Stallone Interview With Ain't It Cool News | publisher AICN |accessdate 2007-01-25   lt; ref gt;

Additionally, Stallone claims that Lundgren nearly forced Carl Weathers to quit in the middle of filming the Apollo versus Drago exhibition fight.  Lungdren tossed Weathers into the corner of the boxing ring, prompting Weathers to leave the ring and announce that he was quitting and calling his agent. lt;ref gt;  cite web | url http   www.aintitcool.com node 30932 | title Stallone Interview With Ain't It Cool News | publisher AICN |accessdate 2007-01-25   lt; ref gt;

'''''Rocky IV''''' is the fourth and most successful movie, in terms of box office gross, of the ''  Rocky  '' franchise.  http   www.boxofficemojo.com franchises chart ?id rocky.htm      Rocky Balboa  character |Rocky Balboa    played again by   Sylvester Stallone   , has said he plans to retire from boxing after recovering his title from   Clubber Lang   in ''  Rocky III  ''.  A new sensation from the   Soviet Union  ,   Ivan Drago  Character |Ivan Drago    played by   Dolph Lundgren   , however, begins to emerge as a top contender.

  Plot  
The year is   1985   and following another friendly sparring match with   Apollo Creed  , Rocky returns to his home in   Philadelphia   to celebrate Paulie's birthday. Its also Rocky and Adrian's  almost  9 year anniversary.   Ivan Drago     Dolph Lundgren   , a highly intimidating 261 pound   Soviet   boxer, arrives in America to challenge the best   United States|American   fighters.   Apollo Creed  , motivated by patriotism and a desire to prove himself after retirement, quickly jumps at the chance to step back into the ring in an exhibition bout against Drago. Despite apprehension from Rocky, who eventually agrees to help train him, Apollo sets the match between himself and Drago in   Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas  . With Rocky in his corner, Apollo flamboyantly makes his way to the ring with a bigger show than when he first fought Rocky, which includes fireworks,   James Brown   performing  quot;  Living in America  song |Living in America  , quot; and a patriotic theme, including a crowd implacably hostile to the visiting Soviet boxer. The match, which apparently was supposed to be for fun, ends in tragedy in the second round as Apollo, who took an unmerciful beating from Drago and refused to allow Rocky to throw in the towel, is killed in the ring by one final hard shot from Drago.
  Image Drago.PNG|thumb|left|200px|Rocky Balboa faces up to Ivan Drago in ''Rocky IV''  
After Apollo's funeral, feeling grief over not stopping the fight, and incensed by Drago's cold indifference to killing Apollo,   quot;If he dies, he dies. quot;  Rocky decides he must avenge Apollo's death and sets a match with the Russian. The match is set for   Christmas Day  , in   Moscow  , but Rocky's title is not on the line because the boxing commission refuses to sanction the fight. Adrian initially cannot understand why Rocky would fight, fearing for his life. Rocky flies to a remote and rustic part of the Soviet Union to train; to help with his training he brings Apollo's former trainer Tony  quot;Duke quot; Evers and his brother-in-law Paulie. Training runs for several months, with Rocky using more humble methods like chopping wood, running up snowy embankments, and lifting huge rocks; Drago is using the most modern equipment coupled with regular injections of what is implied to be   anabolic steroid  s. During one of his runs, Rocky returns to find Adrian waiting for him. With Adrian providing more reason to succeed, Rocky begins to train even harder. 
  Image Dragopunched.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Rocky Balboa delivers the  quot;turning point quot; of the match.   

After intense preparation for both fighters, the two men finally meet in the ring. The match set in Moscow, before the   Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Politburo  , and is broadcast throughout the globe. The crowd is strongly against Rocky, booing him fiercely and cheering Drago, as the American crowd cheered Creed and booed Drago in Las Vegas. After the ring introductions, an impassive Drago tells Rocky,  quot;I must break you. quot; After a pummeling first round, with the Russian easily winning, Rocky comes back toward the end of the second and cuts Drago just below his eye. With Drago's confidence shaken by the injury and Rocky's apparently limitless endurance and resilience, this is a turning point as Rocky and his trainers see that Drago is not superhuman as he appears, conversely while Drago describes Rocky as non-human and a  quot;piece of iron. quot; 

The fight degenerates into a brutal battle of stamina and will across all fifteen rounds. By the end, the Soviet crowd has been won over by Rocky's determination and endurance, and have begun chanting his name. One Politburo member is angered by the crowd's change in mood and gets up to the ring to berate Drago's performance; Drago then throttles the official and tosses him aside, saying  quot;I fight for me...FOR ME....  quot; In the fifteenth and final round, both fighters batter at each other, but Drago's endurance finally runs out, while Rocky finds his last burst of strength and lands one final signature left hook that finally knocks out the Russian.

Following his victory, Rocky gives an impassioned speech to the crowd, acknowledging their initial and mutual disdain for each other, and how they've come to respect and admire each other during the fight. Saying that the brutal battle between him and Drago in the ring was better than war between their two countries, he brings the crowd, including the Politburo, to its feet in applause, by claiming that  quot;if I can change and you can change, then everybody can change  quot;

  Production  
  Expand|date January 2007  
Wyoming doubled for the frozen expanse of the Soviet Union.  The small farm where Rocky lived and trained was located in   Jackson Hole  , and the   Grand Teton National Park   was used for filming many of the outdoor sequences in Russia.  The   PNE Forum   at   Hastings Park   in   Vancouver  ,   British Columbia  , served as the location of Rocky's Soviet bout.  Ironically, the site would later house production of another U.S.-Soviet sports film, ''  Miracle  film  | Miracle  ''. 

Sylvester Stallone has stated that the punching between him and Dolph Lundgren in the first portion of the fight is completely authentic. One particularly forceful punch to Stallone's chest slammed his heart against his breastbone, causing the heart to swell and his breathing to become labored.  Stallone, suffering from labored breathing and a blood pressure over 200, was flown from the set in Canada to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica and was kept in intensive care for eight days. lt;ref gt;  cite web | url http   www.aintitcool.com node 30932 | title Stallone Interview With Ain't It Cool News | publisher AICN |accessdate 2007-01-25   lt; ref gt;

Additionally, Stallone claims that Lundgren nearly forced Carl Weathers to quit in the middle of filming the Apollo versus Drago exhibition fight.  Lungdren tossed Weathers into the corner of the boxing ring, prompting Weathers to leave the ring and announce that he was quitting and calling his agent. lt;ref gt;  cite web | url http   www.aintitcool.com node 30932 | title Stallone Interview With Ain't It Cool News | publisher AICN |accessdate 2007-01-25   lt; ref gt;

  Music  
The   Rocky IV  album |soundtrack   for the movie included  quot;  Living in America  song |Living in America   quot; by   James Brown  ; the film's music was composed by   Vince DiCola  , and also included songs by John Cafferty and The Beaver Brown Band, the band Survivor, Kenny Loggins, and Robert Tepper.

'''''Rocky IV''''' is the fourth and most successful movie, in terms of box office gross, of the ''  Rocky  '' franchise.  http   www.boxofficemojo.com franchises chart ?id rocky.htm      Rocky Balboa  character |Rocky Balboa    played again by   Sylvester Stallone   , has said he plans to retire from boxing after recovering his title from   Clubber Lang   in ''  Rocky III  ''.  A new sensation from the   Soviet Union  ,   Ivan Drago  Character |Ivan Drago    played by   Dolph Lundgren   , however, begins to emerge as a top contender.

  Plot  
The year is   1985   and following another friendly sparring match with   Apollo Creed  , Rocky returns to his home in   Philadelphia   to celebrate Paulie's birthday. Its also Rocky and Adrian's  almost  9 year anniversary.   Ivan Drago     Dolph Lundgren   , a highly intimidating 261 pound   Soviet   boxer, arrives in America to challenge the best   United States|American   fighters.   Apollo Creed  , motivated by patriotism and a desire to prove himself after retirement, quickly jumps at the chance to step back into the ring in an exhibition bout against Drago. Despite apprehension from Rocky, who eventually agrees to help train him, Apollo sets the match between himself and Drago in   Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas  . With Rocky in his corner, Apollo flamboyantly makes his way to the ring with a bigger show than when he first fought Rocky, which includes fireworks,   James Brown   performing  quot;  Living in America  song |Living in America  , quot; and a patriotic theme, including a crowd implacably hostile to the visiting Soviet boxer. The match, which apparently was supposed to be for fun, ends in tragedy in the second round as Apollo, who took an unmerciful beating from Drago and refused to allow Rocky to throw in the towel, is killed in the ring by one final hard shot from Drago.
  Image Drago.PNG|thumb|left|200px|Rocky Balboa faces up to Ivan Drago in ''Rocky IV''  
After Apollo's funeral, feeling grief over not stopping the fight, and incensed by Drago's cold indifference to killing Apollo,   quot;If he dies, he dies. quot;  Rocky decides he must avenge Apollo's death and sets a match with the Russian. The match is set for   Christmas Day  , in   Moscow  , but Rocky's title is not on the line because the boxing commission refuses to sanction the fight. Adrian initially cannot understand why Rocky would fight, fearing for his life. Rocky flies to a remote and rustic part of the Soviet Union to train; to help with his training he brings Apollo's former trainer Tony  quot;Duke quot; Evers and his brother-in-law Paulie. Training runs for several months, with Rocky using more humble methods like chopping wood, running up snowy embankments, and lifting huge rocks; Drago is using the most modern equipment coupled with regular injections of what is implied to be   anabolic steroid  s. During one of his runs, Rocky returns to find Adrian waiting for him. With Adrian providing more reason to succeed, Rocky begins to train even harder. 
  Image Dragopunched.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Rocky Balboa delivers the  quot;turning point quot; of the match.   

After intense preparation for both fighters, the two men finally meet in the ring. The match set in Moscow, before the   Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Politburo  , and is broadcast throughout the globe. The crowd is strongly against Rocky, booing him fiercely and cheering Drago, as the American crowd cheered Creed and booed Drago in Las Vegas. After the ring introductions, an impassive Drago tells Rocky,  quot;I must break you. quot; After a pummeling first round, with the Russian easily winning, Rocky comes back toward the end of the second and cuts Drago just below his eye. With Drago's confidence shaken by the injury and Rocky's apparently limitless endurance and resilience, this is a turning point as Rocky and his trainers see that Drago is not superhuman as he appears, conversely while Drago describes Rocky as non-human and a  quot;piece of iron. quot; 

The fight degenerates into a brutal battle of stamina and will across all fifteen rounds. By the end, the Soviet crowd has been won over by Rocky's determination and endurance, and have begun chanting his name. One Politburo member is angered by the crowd's change in mood and gets up to the ring to berate Drago's performance; Drago then throttles the official and tosses him aside, saying  quot;I fight for me...FOR ME....  quot; In the fifteenth and final round, both fighters batter at each other, but Drago's endurance finally runs out, while Rocky finds his last burst of strength and lands one final signature left hook that finally knocks out the Russian.

Following his victory, Rocky gives an impassioned speech to the crowd, acknowledging their initial and mutual disdain for each other, and how they've come to respect and admire each other during the fight. Saying that the brutal battle between him and Drago in the ring was better than war between their two countries, he brings the crowd, including the Politburo, to its feet in applause, by claiming that  quot;if I can change and you can change, then everybody can change  quot;

  Production  
  Expand|date January 2007  
Wyoming doubled for the frozen expanse of the Soviet Union.  The small farm where Rocky lived and trained was located in   Jackson Hole  , and the   Grand Teton National Park   was used for filming many of the outdoor sequences in Russia.  The   PNE Forum   at   Hastings Park   in   Vancouver  ,   British Columbia  , served as the location of Rocky's Soviet bout.  Ironically, the site would later house production of another U.S.-Soviet sports film, ''  Miracle  film  | Miracle  ''. 

Sylvester Stallone has stated that the punching between him and Dolph Lundgren in the first portion of the fight is completely authentic. One particularly forceful punch to Stallone's chest slammed his heart against his breastbone, causing the heart to swell and his breathing to become labored.  Stallone, suffering from labored breathing and a blood pressure over 200, was flown from the set in Canada to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica and was kept in intensive care for eight days. lt;ref gt;  cite web | url http   www.aintitcool.com node 30932 | title Stallone Interview With Ain't It Cool News | publisher AICN |accessdate 2007-01-25   lt; ref gt;

Additionally, Stallone claims that Lundgren nearly forced Carl Weathers to quit in the middle of filming the Apollo versus Drago exhibition fight.  Lungdren tossed Weathers into the corner of the boxing ring, prompting Weathers to leave the ring and announce that he was quitting and calling his agent. lt;ref gt;  cite web | url http   www.aintitcool.com node 30932 | title Stallone Interview With Ain't It Cool News | publisher AICN |accessdate 2007-01-25   lt; ref gt;

'''''Rocky IV''''' is the fourth and most successful movie, in terms of box office gross, of the ''  Rocky  '' franchise.  http   www.boxofficemojo.com franchises chart ?id rocky.htm      Rocky Balboa  character |Rocky Balboa    played again by   Sylvester Stallone   , has said he plans to retire from boxing and saving the world from evil after recovering his title from   Clubber Lang   in ''  Rocky III  ''.  A new sensation from the   Soviet Union  ,   Ivan Drago  Character |Ivan Drago    played by   Dolph Lundgren   , however, begins to emerge as a top contender and Rocky must wage war against the evil Soviet Empire. Ultimately Rocky Balboa is victorious in the Battle for Moscow in December 1985, defeated both Drago and the entire Soviet Army single-handedly with one punch, thus leading the way for the end of the Cold War. As a result of his victory, Ronald Reagan commemorated Rocky Balboa with the congressional   Medal of Honor  . This was Rocky's second time being awarded the Medal of Honor, the first being shorting after   1945   for his victorious single-handed storming of Normandy and eventual capture of   Berlin    in spite of history's inaccurate claim that it was the   Red Army   that captured Berlin .

  Plot  
The year is   1985   and following yet another prokovative gesture of war by the Soviets, Rocky returns to his home in   Philadelphia   to both celebrate Paulie's birthday and meet with President Ronald Reagan to discuss a possible pre-emptive strike before the Soviets can finish fueling their missiles.   Ivan Drago     Dolph Lundgren   , a highly intimidating 261 pound   Soviet   boxer, arrives in America to challenge the best   United States|American   fighters.   Apollo Creed  , motivated by patriotism and a desire to prove himself after retirement, quickly jumps at the chance to challenge him. The Battle of Washington D.C., which ends in a devastating defeat for the United States in the second round as Apollo, who took an unmerciful beating from Drago, is killed in the ring by one final hard shot from Drago.
  Image Drago.PNG|thumb|left|200px|Rocky Balboa faces up to Ivan Drago in The Battle for Moscow  
After Apollo's funeral, feeling grief over not stopping the fight, and incensed by Drago's cold indifference to killing Apollo,   quot;If he dies, he dies. quot;  Rocky decides he must avenge Apollo's death and defeat the Soviet Union once and for all. In a secret meeting with President Reagan in the war room, Rocky decides to trick the Soviets by staging his fight on   Christmas Day   in   Moscow  . Rocky keeps the Soviets off guard by landing in a remote and rustic part of the Soviet Union and fight his way back towards Moscow where the Red Army was stationed expecting his arrival; to help with his war, Rocky brings Apollo's former trainer Tony  quot;Duke quot; Evers and his brother-in-law Paulie. Campaign runs for several months with Rocky winning numerous battles along his way towards Moscow. Known as the  quot;Second Trail of Tears quot;, millions of Russians were killed or wounded trying to stop Rocky's singel-handed march. In the Battle for Kazan alone, Rocky was able to encircle and capture over 700,000 Russian soldiers, the greatest encirclement in military history, surpassing   Battle for Kiev   during   WWII  .
  Image Dragopunched.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Rocky Balboa delivers the  quot;turning point quot; of the Battle of Moscow.   

After intense preparation for both fighters, the Balboa finally meets Drago in the Boxing ring surrounded by the Soviet Army with the citizens of Moscow watching on, strongly against Rocky, booing him fiercely and cheering Drago, as the American crowd cheered Creed and booed Drago in Las Vegas. After the ring introductions, an impassive Drago tells Rocky,  quot;I must break you. quot; After a pummeling first round, with the Russian easily winning, Rocky comes back toward the end of the second, cutting Drago just below the eye with his patent-pending punch. At the same time, his punch inflicted a huge collateral damage to the Russian Army surrounding the ring, taking out an entire regiment of Russian soldiers just below his eye. With Drago's confidence shaken and the Soviet Army pulling back, Rocky's apparently limitless endurance comes out. This is a turning point of the Battle for Moscow as Rocky and his trainers see that Drago and the Soviet Army is not superhuman as it appears. 

The battle degenerates into a brutal battle of attrition and will across all fifteen rounds as the Soviet Army continues to try and surround Rocky, only to be beaten back and suffer huge casualties. At the same time, Drago's ability to lead the Soviet Army is being destroyed. By the end, the Soviet crowd has been won over by Rocky's determination and endurance, and have begun chanting his name. One Politburo member is angered by the change in the momentum of the battle and gets up to the ring to berate Drago's inability to defeat one man, in spite of the fact he is commanding an army of millions. Drago then throttles the official and tosses him aside, saying  quot;I fight for me...FOR ME....  quot; In the fifteenth and final round, both warriors batter at each other, but Drago's endurance finally runs out, while Rocky finds his last burst of strength and lands one final signature left hook that causes an earthquake that levels Moscow, killing the entire Soviet Army in one move, as well as Drago.

Following his victory, Rocky gives an impassioned speech to the crowd of dying civilians, acknowledging their initial and mutual disdain for each other, and how they've come to respect and admire each other during the war. Saying that the brutal battle between him  being a single man  and Moscow was better than if he had to wage war against the entire world. He brings the crowd, including the surviving Politburo members, to their feet in applause, by claiming that  quot;if I can defeat you with one single punch, then you'd better give up the Cold War  quot;

Following the credits, a final scene shows Rocky Balboa months later receiving the Medal of Honor from President Reagan.

'''''Rocky IV''''' is the fourth and most successful movie, in terms of box office gross, of the ''  Rocky  '' franchise.  http   www.boxofficemojo.com franchises chart ?id rocky.htm      Rocky Balboa  character |Rocky Balboa    played again by   Sylvester Stallone   , has said he plans to retire from boxing and saving the world from evil after recovering his title from   Clubber Lang   in ''  Rocky III  ''.  A new sensation from the   Soviet Union  ,   Ivan Drago  Character |Ivan Drago    played by   Dolph Lundgren   , however, begins to emerge as a top contender and Rocky must wage war against the evil Soviet Empire. Ultimately Rocky Balboa is victorious in the Battle for Moscow in December 1985, defeated both Drago and the entire Soviet Army single-handedly with one punch, thus leading the way for the end of the Cold War. As a result of his victory, Ronald Reagan commemorated Rocky Balboa with the congressional   Medal of Honor  . This was Rocky's second time being awarded the Medal of Honor, the first being shorting after   1945   for his victorious single-handed storming of Normandy and eventual capture of   Berlin    in spite of history's inaccurate claim that it was the   Red Army   that captured Berlin .

  Plot  
The year is   1985   and following yet another prokovative gesture of war by the Soviets, Rocky returns to his home in   Philadelphia   to both celebrate Paulie's birthday and meet with President Ronald Reagan to discuss a possible pre-emptive strike before the Soviets can finish fueling their missiles.   Ivan Drago     Dolph Lundgren   , a highly intimidating 261 pound   Soviet   boxer, arrives in America to challenge the best   United States|American   fighters.   Apollo Creed  , motivated by patriotism and a desire to prove himself after retirement, quickly jumps at the chance to challenge him. The Battle of Washington D.C., which ends in a devastating defeat for the United States in the second round as Apollo, who took an unmerciful beating from Drago, is killed in the ring by one final hard shot from Drago.
  Image Drago.PNG|thumb|left|200px|Rocky Balboa faces up to Ivan Drago in The Battle for Moscow  
After Apollo's funeral, feeling grief over not stopping the fight, and incensed by Drago's cold indifference to killing Apollo,   quot;If he dies, he dies. quot;  Rocky decides he must avenge Apollo's death and defeat the Soviet Union once and for all. In a secret meeting with President Reagan in the war room, Rocky decides to trick the Soviets by staging his fight on   Christmas Day   in   Moscow  . Rocky keeps the Soviets off guard by landing in a remote and rustic part of the Soviet Union and fight his way back towards Moscow where the Red Army was stationed expecting his arrival; to help with his war, Rocky brings Apollo's former trainer Tony  quot;Duke quot; Evers and his brother-in-law Paulie. Campaign runs for several months with Rocky winning numerous battles along his way towards Moscow. Known as the  quot;Second Trail of Tears quot;, millions of Russians were killed or wounded trying to stop Rocky's singel-handed march. In the Battle for Kazan alone, Rocky was able to encircle and capture over 700,000 Russian soldiers, the greatest encirclement in military history, surpassing   Battle for Kiev   during   WWII  .
  Image Dragopunched.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Rocky Balboa delivers the  quot;turning point quot; of the Battle of Moscow.   

After intense preparation for both fighters, the Balboa finally meets Drago in the Boxing ring surrounded by the Soviet Army with the citizens of Moscow watching on, strongly against Rocky, booing him fiercely and cheering Drago, as the American crowd cheered Creed and booed Drago in Las Vegas. After the ring introductions, an impassive Drago tells Rocky,  quot;I must break you. quot; After a pummeling first round, with the Russian easily winning, Rocky comes back toward the end of the second, cutting Drago just below the eye with his patent-pending punch. At the same time, his punch inflicted a huge collateral damage to the Russian Army surrounding the ring, taking out an entire regiment of Russian soldiers just below his eye. With Drago's confidence shaken and the Soviet Army pulling back, Rocky's apparently limitless endurance comes out. This is a turning point of the Battle for Moscow as Rocky and his trainers see that Drago and the Soviet Army is not superhuman as it appears. 

The battle degenerates into a brutal battle of attrition and will across all fifteen rounds as the Soviet Army continues to try and surround Rocky, only to be beaten back and suffer huge casualties. At the same time, Drago's ability to lead the Soviet Army is being destroyed. By the end, the Soviet crowd has been won over by Rocky's determination and endurance, and have begun chanting his name. One Politburo member is angered by the change in the momentum of the battle and gets up to the ring to berate Drago's inability to defeat one man, in spite of the fact he is commanding an army of millions. Drago then throttles the official and tosses him aside, saying  quot;I fight for me...FOR ME....  quot; In the fifteenth and final round, both warriors batter at each other, but Drago's endurance finally runs out, while Rocky finds his last burst of strength and lands one final signature left hook that causes an earthquake that levels Moscow, killing the entire Soviet Army in one move, as well as Drago.

Following his victory, Rocky gives an impassioned speech to the crowd of dying civilians, acknowledging their initial and mutual disdain for each other, and how they've come to respect and admire each other during the war. Saying that the brutal battle between him  being a single man  and Moscow was better than if he had to wage war against the entire world. He brings the crowd, including the surviving Politburo members, to their feet in applause, by claiming that  quot;if I can defeat you with one single punch, then you'd better give up the Cold War  quot;

Following the credits, a final scene shows Rocky Balboa months later receiving the Medal of Honor from President Reagan. Don't forget rockys penis is 19 inches long.

  Production  
  Expand|date January 2007  
Wyoming doubled for the frozen expanse of the Soviet Union.  The small farm where Rocky lived and trained was located in   Jackson Hole  , and the   Grand Teton National Park   was used for filming many of the outdoor sequences in Russia.  The   PNE Forum   at   Hastings Park   in   Vancouver  ,   British Columbia  , served as the location of Rocky's Soviet bout.  Ironically, the site would later house production of another U.S.-Soviet sports film, ''  Miracle  film  | Miracle  ''. 

Sylvester Stallone has stated that the punching between him and Dolph Lundgren in the first portion of the fight is completely authentic. One particularly forceful punch to Stallone's chest slammed his heart against his breastbone, causing the heart to swell and his breathing to become labored.  Stallone, suffering from labored breathing and a blood pressure over 200, was flown from the set in Canada to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica and was kept in intensive care for eight days. lt;ref gt;  cite web | url http   www.aintitcool.com node 30932 | title Stallone Interview With Ain't It Cool News | publisher AICN |accessdate 2007-01-25   lt; ref gt;

Additionally, Stallone claims that Lundgren nearly forced Carl Weathers to quit in the middle of filming the Apollo versus Drago exhibition fight.  Lungdren tossed Weathers into the corner of the boxing ring, prompting Weathers to leave the ring and announce that he was quitting and calling his agent. lt;ref gt;  cite web | url http   www.aintitcool.com node 30932 | title Stallone Interview With Ain't It Cool News | publisher AICN |accessdate 2007-01-25   lt; ref gt;
