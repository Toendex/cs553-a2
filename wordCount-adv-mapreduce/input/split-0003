'''''Rocky IV''''' is the fourth and most successful movie, in terms of box office gross, of the ''  Rocky  '' franchise.  http   www.boxofficemojo.com franchises chart ?id rocky.htm      Rocky Balboa  character |Rocky Balboa    played again by   Sylvester Stallone   , has said he plans to retire from boxing after recovering his title from   Clubber Lang   in ''  Rocky III  ''.  A new sensation from the   Soviet Union  ,   Ivan Drago  Character |Ivan Drago    played by   Dolph Lundgren   , however, begins to emerge as a top contender.

  Plot  
The year is   1985   and following another friendly sparring match with   Apollo Creed  , Rocky returns to his home in   Philadelphia   to celebrate Paulie's birthday. Its also Rocky and Adrian's  almost  9 year anniversary.   Ivan Drago     Dolph Lundgren   , a highly intimidating 261 pound   Soviet   boxer, arrives in America with his wife Ludmilla, his manager, Igor Rimsky, and a team of trainers to challenge the best   United States|American   fighters.   Apollo Creed  , motivated by patriotism and a desire to prove himself after retirement, quickly jumps at the chance to step back into the ring in an exhibition bout against Drago. Despite apprehension from Rocky, who eventually agrees to help train him, Apollo sets the match between himself and Drago in   Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas  . With Rocky in his corner, Apollo flamboyantly makes his way to the ring with a bigger show than when he first fought Rocky, which includes fireworks,   James Brown   performing  quot;  Living in America  song |Living in America  , quot; and a patriotic theme, including a crowd implacably hostile to the visiting Soviet boxer. The match, which apparently was supposed to be for fun, ends in tragedy in the second round as Apollo, who took an unmerciful beating from Drago and refused to allow Rocky to throw in the towel, is killed in the ring by one final hard shot from Drago.

After Apollo's funeral, feeling grief over not stopping the fight, and incensed by Drago's cold indifference to killing Apollo,   quot;If he dies, he dies. quot;  Rocky decides he must avenge Apollo's death and sets a match with the Russian. The match is set for   Christmas Day  , in   Moscow  , but neither Rocky's title is on the line nor is there any purse because the boxing commission refuses to sanction the fight.  Furthermore, Rocky must give up his title because Drago is technically still an amateur boxer.  Adrian initially cannot understand why Rocky would fight, fearing for his life. Rocky flies to a remote and rustic part of the Soviet Union to train; to help with his training he brings Apollo's former trainer Tony  quot;Duke quot; Evers and his brother-in-law Paulie. Training runs for several months, with Rocky using more humble methods like chopping wood, running up snowy embankments, and lifting huge rocks; Drago is using the most modern equipment coupled with regular injections of what is implied to be   anabolic steroid  s. During one of his runs, Rocky returns to find Adrian waiting for him. With Adrian finally showing her support and providing more reason to succeed, Rocky begins to train even harder. 
  Image Dragopunched.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Rocky Balboa delivers the  quot;turning point quot; of the match.   

After intense preparation for both fighters, the two men finally meet in the ring. The match set in Moscow, before the   Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Politburo  , and is broadcast throughout the globe. The crowd is strongly against Rocky, booing him fiercely and cheering Drago, as the American crowd cheered Creed and booed Drago in Las Vegas. After the ring introductions, an impassive Drago tells Rocky,  quot;I must break you. quot; After a pummeling first round, with the Russian easily winning, Rocky comes back toward the end of the second and cuts Drago just below his eye. With Drago's confidence shaken by the injury and Rocky's apparently limitless endurance and resilience, this is a turning point as Rocky and his trainers see that Drago is not superhuman as he appears, conversely while Drago describes Rocky as non-human and a  quot;piece of iron. quot; 

The fight degenerates into a brutal battle of stamina and will across all fifteen rounds. By the end, the Soviet crowd has been won over by Rocky's determination and endurance, and have begun chanting his name.  Rimsky, angered by the crowd's change in mood and fearful of retribution from the Soviet premier, gets up from the premier's box and goes to Drago's corner to berate his  performance.  Drago clutches Rimsky by the throat, lifts him off the ground, and tosses him aside, saying  quot;I fight for me...FOR ME....  quot; In the fifteenth and final round, both fighters batter at each other, but Drago's endurance finally runs out, while Rocky finds his last burst of strength and lands one final signature left hook that finally knocks out the Russian.

Following his victory, Rocky gives an impassioned speech to the crowd, acknowledging their initial and mutual disdain for each other, and how they've come to respect and admire each other during the fight. Saying that the brutal battle between him and Drago in the ring was better than war between their two countries, he brings the crowd, including the Politburo, to its feet in applause, by claiming that  quot;if I can change and you can change, then everybody can change  quot;

  Production  
  Expand|date January 2007  
Wyoming doubled for the frozen expanse of the Soviet Union.  The small farm where Rocky lived and trained was located in   Jackson Hole  , and the   Grand Teton National Park   was used for filming many of the outdoor sequences in Russia.  The   PNE Forum   at   Hastings Park   in   Vancouver  ,   British Columbia  , served as the location of Rocky's Soviet bout.  Ironically, the site would later house production of another U.S.-Soviet sports film, ''  Miracle  film  | Miracle  ''. 

Sylvester Stallone has stated that the punching between him and Dolph Lundgren in the first portion of the fight is completely authentic. One particularly forceful punch to Stallone's chest slammed his heart against his breastbone, causing the heart to swell and his breathing to become labored.  Stallone, suffering from labored breathing and a blood pressure over 200, was flown from the set in Canada to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica and was kept in intensive care for eight days. lt;ref gt;  cite web | url http   www.aintitcool.com node 30932 | title Stallone Interview With Ain't It Cool News | publisher AICN |accessdate 2007-01-25   lt; ref gt;

Additionally, Stallone claims that Lundgren nearly forced Carl Weathers to quit in the middle of filming the Apollo versus Drago exhibition fight.  Lungdren tossed Weathers into the corner of the boxing ring, prompting Weathers to leave the ring and announce that he was quitting and calling his agent. lt;ref gt;  cite web | url http   www.aintitcool.com node 30932 | title Stallone Interview With Ain't It Cool News | publisher AICN |accessdate 2007-01-25   lt; ref gt;

'''''Rocky IV''''' is the fourth and most successful movie, in terms of box office gross, of the ''  Rocky  '' franchise.  http   www.boxofficemojo.com franchises chart ?id rocky.htm      Rocky Balboa  character |Rocky Balboa    played again by   Sylvester Stallone   , has said he plans to retire from boxing after recovering his title from   Clubber Lang   in ''  Rocky III  ''.  A new sensation from the   Soviet Union  ,   Ivan Drago  Character |Ivan Drago    played by   Dolph Lundgren   , however, begins to emerge as a top contender.

  Plot  
The year is   1985   and following another friendly sparring match with   Apollo Creed  , Rocky returns to his home in   Philadelphia   to celebrate Paulie's birthday. Its also Rocky and Adrian's  almost  9 year anniversary.   Ivan Drago     Dolph Lundgren   , a highly intimidating 261 pound   Soviet   boxer, arrives in America with his wife Ludmilla, his manager, Igor Rimsky, and a team of trainers to challenge the best   United States|American   fighters.   Apollo Creed  , motivated by patriotism and a desire to prove himself after retirement, quickly jumps at the chance to step back into the ring in an exhibition bout against Drago. Despite apprehension from Rocky, who eventually agrees to help train him, Apollo sets the match between himself and Drago in   Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas  . With Rocky in his corner, Apollo flamboyantly makes his way to the ring with a bigger show than when he first fought Rocky, which includes fireworks,   James Brown   performing  quot;  Living in America  song |Living in America  , quot; and a patriotic theme, including a crowd implacably hostile to the visiting Soviet boxer. The match, which apparently was supposed to be for fun, ends in tragedy in the second round as Apollo, who took an unmerciful beating from Drago and refused to allow Rocky to throw in the towel, is killed in the ring by one final hard shot from Drago.

After Apollo's funeral, feeling grief over not stopping the fight, and incensed by Drago's cold indifference to killing Apollo,   quot;If he dies, he dies. quot;  Rocky decides he must avenge Apollo's death and sets a match with the Russian. The match is set for   Christmas Day  , in   Moscow  , but neither Rocky's title is on the line nor is there any purse because the boxing commission refuses to sanction the fight.  Furthermore, Rocky must give up his title because Drago is technically still an amateur boxer.  Adrian initially cannot understand why Rocky would fight, fearing for his life. Rocky flies to a remote and rustic part of the Soviet Union to train; to help with his training he brings Apollo's former trainer Tony  quot;Duke quot; Evers and his brother-in-law Paulie. Training runs for several months, with Rocky using more humble methods like chopping wood, running up snowy embankments, and lifting huge rocks; Drago is using the most modern equipment coupled with regular injections of what is implied to be   anabolic steroid  s. During one of his runs, Rocky returns to find Adrian waiting for him. With Adrian finally showing her support and providing more reason to succeed, Rocky begins to train even harder.

After intense preparation for both fighters, the two men finally meet in the ring. The match set in Moscow, before the   Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Politburo  , and is broadcast throughout the globe. The crowd is strongly against Rocky, booing him fiercely and cheering Drago, as the American crowd cheered Creed and booed Drago in Las Vegas. After the ring introductions, an impassive Drago tells Rocky,  quot;I must break you. quot; After a pummeling first round, with the Russian easily winning, Rocky comes back toward the end of the second and cuts Drago just below his eye. With Drago's confidence shaken by the injury and Rocky's apparently limitless endurance and resilience, this is a turning point as Rocky and his trainers see that Drago is not superhuman as he appears, conversely while Drago describes Rocky as non-human and a  quot;piece of iron. quot; 

The fight degenerates into a brutal battle of stamina and will across all fifteen rounds. By the end, the Soviet crowd has been won over by Rocky's determination and endurance, and have begun chanting his name.  Rimsky, angered by the crowd's change in mood and fearful of retribution from the Soviet premier, gets up from the premier's box and goes to Drago's corner to berate his  performance.  Drago clutches Rimsky by the throat, lifts him off the ground, and tosses him aside, saying  quot;I fight to win...for me...FOR ME....  quot;  the last part directed at the premier   In the fifteenth and final round, both fighters batter at each other, but Drago's endurance finally runs out, while Rocky finds his last burst of strength and lands one final signature left hook that finally knocks out the Russian.

Following his victory, Rocky gives an impassioned speech to the crowd, acknowledging their initial and mutual disdain for each other, and how they've come to respect and admire each other during the fight. Saying that the brutal battle between him and Drago in the ring was better than war between their two countries, he brings the crowd, including the Politburo, to its feet in applause, by claiming that  quot;if I can change and you can change, then everybody can change  quot;

  Production  
  Expand|date January 2007  
Wyoming doubled for the frozen expanse of the Soviet Union.  The small farm where Rocky lived and trained was located in   Jackson Hole  , and the   Grand Teton National Park   was used for filming many of the outdoor sequences in Russia.  The   PNE Forum   at   Hastings Park   in   Vancouver  ,   British Columbia  , served as the location of Rocky's Soviet bout.  Ironically, the site would later house production of another U.S.-Soviet sports film, ''  Miracle  film  | Miracle  ''. 

Sylvester Stallone has stated that the punching between him and Dolph Lundgren in the first portion of the fight is completely authentic. One particularly forceful punch to Stallone's chest slammed his heart against his breastbone, causing the heart to swell and his breathing to become labored.  Stallone, suffering from labored breathing and a blood pressure over 200, was flown from the set in Canada to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica and was kept in intensive care for eight days. lt;ref gt;  cite web | url http   www.aintitcool.com node 30932 | title Stallone Interview With Ain't It Cool News | publisher AICN |accessdate 2007-01-25   lt; ref gt;

Additionally, Stallone claims that Lundgren nearly forced Carl Weathers to quit in the middle of filming the Apollo versus Drago exhibition fight.  Lungdren tossed Weathers into the corner of the boxing ring, prompting Weathers to leave the ring and announce that he was quitting and calling his agent. lt;ref gt;  cite web | url http   www.aintitcool.com node 30932 | title Stallone Interview With Ain't It Cool News | publisher AICN |accessdate 2007-01-25   lt; ref gt;

A new sensation from the   Soviet Union  ,   Ivan Drago  Character |Ivan Drago    played by   Dolph Lundgren   , however, begins to emerge as a top contender.

  Plot  
The year is   1985   and following another friendly sparring match with   Apollo Creed  , Rocky returns to his home in   Philadelphia   to celebrate Paulie's birthday. Its also Rocky and Adrian's  almost  9 year anniversary.   Ivan Drago     Dolph Lundgren   , a highly intimidating 261 pound   Soviet   boxer, arrives in America with his wife Ludmilla, his manager, Nicolai Koloff, and a team of trainers headed by Igor Rimsky to challenge the best   United States|American   fighters.   Apollo Creed  , motivated by patriotism and a desire to prove himself after retirement, quickly jumps at the chance to step back into the ring in an exhibition bout against Drago. Despite apprehension from Rocky, who eventually agrees to help train him, Apollo sets the match between himself and Drago in   Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas  . With Rocky in his corner, Apollo flamboyantly makes his way to the ring with a bigger show than when he first fought Rocky, which includes fireworks,   James Brown   performing  quot;  Living in America  song |Living in America  , quot; and a patriotic theme, including a crowd implacably hostile to the visiting Soviet boxer. The match, which apparently was supposed to be for fun, ends in tragedy in the second round as Apollo, who took an unmerciful beating from Drago and refused to allow Rocky to throw in the towel, is killed in the ring by one final hard shot from Drago.

After Apollo's funeral, feeling grief over not stopping the fight, and incensed by Drago's cold indifference to killing Apollo,   quot;If he dies, he dies. quot;  Rocky decides he must avenge Apollo's death and sets a match with the Russian. The match is set for   Christmas Day  , in   Moscow  , but neither Rocky's title is on the line nor is there any purse because the boxing commission refuses to sanction the fight.  Furthermore, Rocky must give up his title because Drago is technically still an amateur boxer.  Adrian initially cannot understand why Rocky would fight, fearing for his life. Rocky flies to a remote and rustic part of the Soviet Union to train; to help with his training he brings Apollo's former trainer Tony  quot;Duke quot; Evers and his brother-in-law Paulie. Training runs for several months, with Rocky using more humble methods like chopping wood, running up snowy embankments, and lifting huge rocks; Drago is using the most modern equipment coupled with regular injections of what is implied to be   anabolic steroid  s. During one of his runs, Rocky returns to find Adrian waiting for him. With Adrian finally showing her support and providing more reason to succeed, Rocky begins to train even harder.

After intense preparation for both fighters, the two men finally meet in the ring. The match set in Moscow, before the   Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Politburo  , and is broadcast throughout the globe. The crowd is strongly against Rocky, booing him fiercely and cheering Drago, as the American crowd cheered Creed and booed Drago in Las Vegas. After the ring introductions, an impassive Drago tells Rocky,  quot;I must break you. quot; After a pummeling first round, with the Russian easily winning, Rocky comes back toward the end of the second and cuts Drago just below his eye. With Drago's confidence shaken by the injury and Rocky's apparently limitless endurance and resilience, this is a turning point as Rocky and his trainers see that Drago is not superhuman as he appears, conversely while Drago describes Rocky as non-human and a  quot;piece of iron. quot; 

The fight degenerates into a brutal battle of stamina and will across all fifteen rounds. By the end, the Soviet crowd has been won over by Rocky's determination and endurance, and have begun chanting his name.  Koloff, angered by the crowd's change in mood and fearful of retribution from the Soviet premier, gets up from the premier's box and goes to Drago's corner to berate his  performance.  Drago clutches Koloff by the throat, lifts him off the ground, and tosses him aside, saying  quot;I fight to win...for me...FOR ME....  quot;  the last part directed at the premier   In the fifteenth and final round, both fighters batter at each other, but Drago's endurance finally runs out, while Rocky finds his last burst of strength and lands one final signature left hook that finally knocks out the Russian.

Following his victory, Rocky gives an impassioned speech to the crowd, acknowledging their initial and mutual disdain for each other, and how they've come to respect and admire each other during the fight. Saying that the brutal battle between him and Drago in the ring was better than war between their two countries, he brings the crowd, including the Politburo, to its feet in applause, by claiming that  quot;if I can change and you can change, then everybody can change  quot;

  Production  
  Expand|date January 2007  
Wyoming doubled for the frozen expanse of the Soviet Union.  The small farm where Rocky lived and trained was located in   Jackson Hole  , and the   Grand Teton National Park   was used for filming many of the outdoor sequences in Russia.  The   PNE Forum   at   Hastings Park   in   Vancouver  ,   British Columbia  , served as the location of Rocky's Soviet bout.  Ironically, the site would later house production of another U.S.-Soviet sports film, ''  Miracle  film  | Miracle  ''. 

Sylvester Stallone has stated that the punching between him and Dolph Lundgren in the first portion of the fight is completely authentic. One particularly forceful punch to Stallone's chest slammed his heart against his breastbone, causing the heart to swell and his breathing to become labored.  Stallone, suffering from labored breathing and a blood pressure over 200, was flown from the set in Canada to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica and was kept in intensive care for eight days. lt;ref gt;  cite web | url http   www.aintitcool.com node 30932 | title Stallone Interview With Ain't It Cool News | publisher AICN |accessdate 2007-01-25   lt; ref gt;

Additionally, Stallone claims that Lundgren nearly forced Carl Weathers to quit in the middle of filming the Apollo versus Drago exhibition fight.  Lungdren tossed Weathers into the corner of the boxing ring, prompting Weathers to leave the ring and announce that he was quitting and calling his agent. lt;ref gt;  cite web | url http   www.aintitcool.com node 30932 | title Stallone Interview With Ain't It Cool News | publisher AICN |accessdate 2007-01-25   lt; ref gt;

A new sensation from the   Soviet Union  ,   Ivan Drago  Character |Ivan Drago    played by   Dolph Lundgren   , however, begins to emerge as a top contender.

  Plot  
The year is   1985   and following another friendly sparring match with   Apollo Creed  , Rocky returns to his home in   Philadelphia   to celebrate Paulie's birthday. Its also Rocky and Adrian's  almost  9 year anniversary.   Ivan Drago     Dolph Lundgren   , a highly intimidating 261 pound   Soviet   boxer, arrives in America with his wife Ludmilla, his manager, Nicolai Koloff, and a team of trainers headed by Igor Rimsky to challenge the best   United States|American   fighters.   Apollo Creed  , motivated by patriotism and a desire to prove himself after retirement, quickly jumps at the chance to step back into the ring in an exhibition bout against Drago. Despite apprehension from Rocky, who eventually agrees to help train him, Apollo sets the match between himself and Drago in   Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas  . With Rocky in his corner, Apollo flamboyantly makes his way to the ring with a bigger show than when he first fought Rocky, which includes fireworks,   James Brown   performing  quot;  Living in America  song |Living in America  , quot; and a patriotic theme, including a crowd implacably hostile to the visiting Soviet boxer. The match, which apparently was supposed to be for fun, ends in tragedy in the second round as Apollo, who took an unmerciful beating from Drago and refused to allow Rocky to throw in the towel, is killed in the ring by one final hard shot from Drago.

After Apollo's funeral, feeling grief over not stopping the fight, and incensed by Drago's cold indifference to killing Apollo,   quot;If he dies, he dies. quot;  Rocky decides he must avenge Apollo's death and sets a match with the Russian. The match is set for   Christmas Day  , in   Moscow  , but neither Rocky's title is on the line nor is there any purse because the boxing commission refuses to sanction the fight.  Furthermore, Rocky must give up his title because Drago is technically still an amateur boxer.  Adrian initially cannot understand why Rocky would fight, fearing for his life. Rocky flies to a remote and rustic part of the Soviet Union to train; to help with his training he brings Apollo's former trainer Tony  quot;Duke quot; Evers and his brother-in-law Paulie. Training runs for several months, with Rocky using more humble methods like chopping wood, running up snowy embankments, and lifting huge rocks; Drago is using the most modern equipment coupled with regular injections of what is implied to be   anabolic steroid  s. During one of his runs, Rocky returns to find Adrian waiting for him. With Adrian finally showing her support and providing more reason to succeed, Rocky begins to train even harder. 
  Image Dragopunched.PNG|thumb|right|200px|Rocky Balboa delivers the  quot;turning point quot; of the match.   

After intense preparation for both fighters, the two men finally meet in the ring. The match set in Moscow, before the   Politburo of the CPSU Central Committee|Politburo  , and is broadcast throughout the globe. The crowd is strongly against Rocky, booing him fiercely and cheering Drago, as the American crowd cheered Creed and booed Drago in Las Vegas. After the ring introductions, an impassive Drago tells Rocky,  quot;I must break you. quot; After a pummeling first round, with the Russian easily winning, Rocky comes back toward the end of the second and cuts Drago just below his eye. With Drago's confidence shaken by the injury and Rocky's apparently limitless endurance and resilience, this is a turning point as Rocky and his trainers see that Drago is not superhuman as he appears, conversely while Drago describes Rocky as non-human and a  quot;piece of iron. quot; 

The fight degenerates into a brutal battle of stamina and will across all fifteen rounds. By the end, the Soviet crowd has been won over by Rocky's determination and endurance, and have begun chanting his name.  Koloff, angered by the crowd's change in mood and fearful of retribution from the Soviet premier, gets up from the premier's box and goes to Drago's corner to berate his  performance.  Drago clutches Koloff by the throat, lifts him off the ground, and tosses him aside, saying  quot;I fight to win...for me...FOR ME....  quot;  the last part directed at the premier   In the fifteenth and final round, both fighters batter at each other, but Drago's endurance finally runs out, while Rocky finds his last burst of strength and lands one final signature left hook that finally knocks out the Russian.

Following his victory, Rocky gives an impassioned speech to the crowd, acknowledging their initial and mutual disdain for each other, and how they've come to respect and admire each other during the fight. Saying that the brutal battle between him and Drago in the ring was better than war between their two countries, he brings the crowd, including the Politburo, to its feet in applause, by claiming that  quot;if I can change... and you can change... then we all can change  quot;

  Production  
  Expand|date January 2007  
The soviet montage in this movie is beyond compare.
Wyoming doubled for the frozen expanse of the Soviet Union.  The small farm where Rocky lived and trained was located in   Jackson Hole  , and the   Grand Teton National Park   was used for filming many of the outdoor sequences in Russia.  The   PNE Forum   at   Hastings Park   in   Vancouver  ,   British Columbia  , served as the location of Rocky's Soviet bout.  Ironically, the site would later house production of another U.S.-Soviet sports film, ''  Miracle  film  | Miracle  ''. 

Sylvester Stallone has stated that the punching between him and Dolph Lundgren in the first portion of the fight is completely authentic. One particularly forceful punch to Stallone's chest slammed his heart against his breastbone, causing the heart to swell and his breathing to become labored.  Stallone, suffering from labored breathing and a blood pressure over 200, was flown from the set in Canada to St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica and was kept in intensive care for eight days. lt;ref gt;  cite web | url http   www.aintitcool.com node 30932 | title Stallone Interview With Ain't It Cool News | publisher AICN |accessdate 2007-01-25   lt; ref gt;

Additionally, Stallone claims that Lundgren nearly forced Carl Weathers to quit in the middle of filming the Apollo versus Drago exhibition fight.  Lungdren tossed Weathers into the corner of the boxing ring, prompting Weathers to leave the ring and announce that he was quitting and calling his agent. lt;ref gt;  cite web | url http   www.aintitcool.com node 30932 | title Stallone Interview With Ain't It Cool News | publisher AICN |accessdate 2007-01-25   lt; ref gt;
